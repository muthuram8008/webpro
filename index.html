<h2> FEW WORDS</h2> 

<P> 
    <br>suriya is an Indian actor, producer and distributor who works primarily in Tamil cinema.[1][2] He made a commercially successful cinematic debut in Vasanth's Nerrukku Ner (1997).[3][4] After few critical and commercial failures, Suriya collaborated with Vasanth again in Poovellam Kettuppar (1999), his first film with his future wife Jyothika.<br/>

    <br>In 2001, Suriya starred in Bala's Nandha as an ex-convict trying to find his place in society.[6] The film was critically acclaimed and became a turning point in his career.[7][8] His roles as a police officer in Gautham Vasudev Menon's Kaakha Kaakha (which became his first blockbuster) and a con artist in Bala's Pithamagan, established him as one of Tamil cinema's leading actors.[3][9] Suriya's performances in both films were praised, winning him a Best Actor nomination for the former and the Best Supporting Actor for Pithamagan at the 51st Filmfare Awards South.[10] The following year, he played dual roles—a hunchback and a college student—in Perazhagan. Suriya's performance was again praised, and he received his first Filmfare Best Actor award.[6][11] He was also acclaimed for his performance as a student leader in Mani Ratnam's Aayutha Ezhuthu (2004).<br>
